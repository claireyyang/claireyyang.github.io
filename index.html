										<h2>Claire Yang</h2>
										<p>B.S. in Computer Science & Psychology minor at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities (Spring 2021)</p>
									</header>
									<p>My research interests are in artificial intelligence and human computer interaction, with a particular emphasis on human behavior, mental health, and the social implications of technology on communities. I have conducted research as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Paul Schrater’s lab, and I was previously an undergraduate researcher in GroupLens Research, under Dr. Lana Yarosh. In 2020-2021, I conducted NLP research with Smart Information Flow Technologies in Minneapolis and interned in platform engineering at HubSpot in Boston, where I am currently working full-time as a software engineer. I am passionate about engaging with local non-profits through service design and UX design volunteer work, and I also have experience consulting and leading teams in both academia and industry. I love learning, staying active, and giving back to my community in whatever way possible.</p>
