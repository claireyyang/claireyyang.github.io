									</header>
									
									<p>I am a 1st year Ph.D. student at the University of Washington Allen School, joining the <a href="https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/">Human-Centered Robotics Lab</a>, working with Prof. Maya Cakmak and Prof. Max Kleiman-Weiner. <br><br> I am interested in investigating human cognition and applying that understanding of human behavior to create more effective and inclusive assistive technologies. I previously worked as a backend software engineer at HubSpot, applying Generative AI research to create innovative interactions and products. I am passionate about engaging with local non-profits through UX design volunteer work, and I also have experience consulting and leading teams in both academia and industry. I love learning, staying active, and giving back to my community in whatever way possible.</p>

									<h3>Research</h3>
								</header>
								<p>My research background is primarily in human computer interaction and how artificial intelligence can model human
									behavior and decision making. In my career, I aim to combine these interests to investigate how we can center
									diverse human needs while developing algorithms/building systems to improve people's well-being. I intend to approach this work from diverse perspectives–I believe that this research requires not only creating new technologies, but also inquiring how they interact with and impact different populations, both during the creation process and upon
									deployment.</p>
